# Pokédex
A simple Pokédex, programmed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript which uses the data from the RESTful PokéAPI.

## Overview
With this project, I pursued the goal of deepening my knowledge of how to query data from an API and expanding my JavaScript skills. 
The end result is a fully responsive Pokédex that provides an overview of all Pokémon and the ability to display even more details about each Pokémon. 
I also implemented a search function that allows you to filter Pokémon that have already been loaded by keyword.
